## Getting Started with Toucan

### Step 1: Initialize a New Site

1. Create a new site by running:

   - Run the following command in your terminal, replacing **my-site** with your desired project folder name:

   ```bash
   toucan init my-site
   ```

   - Toucan will generate a folder with your chosen name, including default configuration files and templates.

2. Navigate to your new site folder:

   ```bash
   cd my-site
   ```

Once your site is initialized, your project will have the following structure:

```text
my-site/
├── LICENSE            # License file for the project
├── Makefile           # Makefile for building and managing the project
├── README.md          # Project README file
├── docs/              # Folder containing generated static files (HTML, CSS, etc.)
└── src/               # Source files for content and templates
```

---

### Step 2: Generate Your Site

1. Run the following command to generate the static files:

   ```bash
   toucan generate
   ```

   - Toucan processes your content and templates, producing static HTML files in the `docs` directory.

### Step 3: Watch for changes (only for macOS for now)

The watch command monitors a source directory for changes and automatically regenerates the site whenever changes are detected.

1. Run the following command to enable file watching:

   ```bash
   toucan watch
   ```

### Step 4: Serve Your Site Locally

1. Start a local development server:

   ```bash
   toucan serve
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

   - This allows you to preview your site locally.

## Copy Theme and Default Contents

### Delete files

Delete all files from the:

1. **my-site/src/assets** folder
2. **my-site/src/contents** folder
3. **my-site/src/pipelines** folder
4. **my-site/src/themes/default** folder
5. **my-site/src/types** folder

### Copy files

1. Copy all files from the **t-doc-theme-1.0.0-beta.1/assets** folder in the ZIP file and paste them into the **my-site/src/assets** folder.

2. Copy all files from the **t-doc-theme-1.0.0-beta.1/contents** folder in the ZIP file and paste them into the **my-site/src/contents** folder.

3. Copy all files from the **t-doc-theme-1.0.0-beta.1/pipelines** folder in the ZIP file and paste them into the **my-site/src/pipelines** folder.

4. Copy all files from the **t-doc-theme-1.0.0-beta.1/theme** folder in the ZIP file and paste them into the **my-site/src/themes/default** folder.

5. Copy all files from the **t-doc-theme-1.0.0-beta.1/types** folder in the ZIP file and paste them into the **my-site/src/types** folder.

6. Copy the file **t-doc-theme-1.0.0-beta.1/config.yml** in the ZIP file and paste it into the **my-site/src** folder.

7. Copy the file **t-doc-theme-1.0.0-beta.1/site.yml** in the ZIP file and paste it into the **my-site/src** folder.

After successful file copies, your project will have the following structure:

```text
my-site/
├── docs
└── src/
      ├── assets/
      ├── contents/
      │   ├── 404
      │   ├── about
      │   ├── assets
      │   ├── authors
      │   ├── home
      │   ├── lists
      │   ├── posts
      │   ├── tags
      │   └── site.yml
      ├── pipelines/
      │   ├── 404.yml
      │   ├── api.yml
      │   ├── html.yml
      │   ├── redirect.yml
      │   ├── rss.yml
      │   ├── sitemap.yml
      └── themes/
      │   └── default/
      │      ├── assets
      │      ├── blocks
      │      ├── templates
      │      └── types
      ├── types/
      └── config.yml
      └── site.yml
```

10. Once all files are successfully copied, regenerate your site to apply the changes:

    - First run the following command:

    ```
    toucan generate
    ```

    - After successful generation, run the following command:

```
toucan serve
```

The theme comes with a variety of sample content to help you quickly understand how to structure and manage your site. These include:

## Default Contents

1. Tags:
   - Multiple tags are provided in **src/contents/tags/**.
   - This demonstrates how tags are created and displayed.
2. Authors:
   - A test author is included in **src/contents/authors/**.
   - This shows how to add and customize author profiles.
3. Posts:
   - Several sample posts are included in **src/contents/posts/**.
   - These showcase how to write Markdown-based posts with metadata and images.
4. 404 Page:
   - A preconfigured “Page Not Found” template is located in **src/contents/404/**.
5. About Page:
   - A sample “About” page is included in **src/contents/about/** to demonstrate static page creation.
6. Assets:
   - Default images and icons are stored in **src/contents/assets/**.
   - Includes logos, placeholders, and theme-specific assets.
7. Home Page Content:
   - A preconfigured home page setup is included in **src/contents/home/**.

You can use these sample files as a reference or starting point for your project. Once you’re familiar with the structure, replace them with your own custom content.

Happy building with Toucan!
